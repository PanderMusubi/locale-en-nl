% English language locale for the Netherlands with euro
%
% Internationally oriented users who are physically located in the Netherlands
% use software mainly in the English language. Therefore they have their systems
% usually configured to US English International. However, due to the geographic
% location, it can be desirable for certain data to be represented according to
% the local Dutch notation while the rest remains in English.
%
% Therefore this locale called en_NL has been created. It is based on en_US and
% has some parts from nl_NL. Please see comments starting with "%% use" how each
% section has been composed. Note that this specific configuration is difficult
% to obtain by using locale nl_NL and setting LANGUAGES to en.
%
% Systems located in the Netherlands which are configured for the US English
% International usually have LANG=en_US(.UTF-8) and LANGUAGE=en_US:en. Using
% this file as en_NL /could/ trigger undesirable side effects. The following
% quick and dirty instructions are the most failsafe to actrivate this locale:
%   $ sudo su
%   # cd /usr/share/i18n/locales
%   # mv en_US .en_US.org
%   # cp /tmp/en_NL en_US
%   # cp /tmp/en_NL@euro en_US@euro
%   # locale-gen
% Perhaps also restart your active sessions.
