English language locale for the Netherlands

Internationally oriented users who are physically located in the Netherlands
use software mainly in the English language. Therefore they have their systems
usually configured to US English International. However, due to the geographic
location, it can be desirable for certain data to be represented according to
the local Dutch notation while the rest remains in English.

Therefore this locale called en_NL has been created. It is based on en_US and
has some parts from nl_NL. Please see comments starting with "%% use" how each
section has been composed. Note that this specific configuration is difficult
to obtain by using locale nl_NL and setting LANGUAGES to en.

See all comments in file en_NL for more details and installation.
